      <!--Overview Paragraph-->
      <div id="tribute-info">
        <p>Before 2021, Laura Kerrivan was considered to be the "Greatest Legacy of Failure" in ESPLAR Motorsports. Racing in the top division of the Evanshire Super Pro League of Auto Racing from 2010 until 2021, Kerrivan notched 18 wins, 29 top 5s and 68 top 10 finishes. Her championship runs never seen to have ended well no matter how much she tried, as Mylo-Kerrivan Motorsports, the team her father Ben Kerrivan co-owned until 2022, was often cursed with bad cars, technical issues, and wrecks not of her own doing. Now, after winning her only championship in 2021, Kerrivan will go down as among the last of the old guard of the 2010s era, with ESPLAR increasingly dominated by younger drivers.</p>
